# Word-Guess-Game
## Javascript Assignment

I am currently a student in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. We've spent 3 weeks traversing HTML and CSS and now our week 4 assignment is to make a simple *Hangman Game* using Javascript.

I choose the theme for my game to be **USA Landmarks**. I hope you enjoy checking it out.

### Here are the requirements of the assignment:

1. Choose a theme for your game! 

2. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

3. Display the following on the page:

     * Press any key to get started!

     * Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

     * If the word is `grand canyon`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _`.

     * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `g _ a n _  c a n y _ n`.

     * Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

     * Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

4. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
